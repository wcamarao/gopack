# gopack

**gopack** is a Golang asset pipeline library with built-in support for JavaScript, Sass, and static files, extensible by an **open-ended interface** for community-driven libraries. It's inspired by johnpapa's [angular-styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide), module loaders from [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), Python's explicit [code style](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/), and [effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

It's still a work in progress and should only be used at this point if you're interested in contributing. The roadmap and work-in-progres documentation are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/wcamarao/gopack/wiki).
